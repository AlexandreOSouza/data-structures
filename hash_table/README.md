# Hash Tables

- Works with (key and value)
- Time of O(1)
- Fast lookups
- Fast inserts
- Flexible Keys
- Unordered
- Slow key iterations

## Hash Methods

- Insert -> O(1)
- Lookup -> O(1)
- Delete -> O(1)
- Serach -> O(1)

## Hash Collisions

- Slow down to O(n)

## Hash Function

- A function that generate a value of a fixed length of each input that get
- Its one way
- Its always the same output for the same input
- Generate the hash and transform into a memory space
